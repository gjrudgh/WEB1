    CSS continues to release new versions. CSS 1 , introduced in 1996, was the basis for CSS. CSS standard is CSS 2.1 , and new features and tools are added compared to previous versions. Most web browsers support CSS 2.1 well ( Internet Explorer supports CSS2.1 as of version 7.) Currently, W3C makes CSS3 a standard.
